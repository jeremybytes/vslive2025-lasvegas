## Sessions  

**W02: DI Why? Getting a Grip on Dependency Injection**  
*Level: Introductory / Intermediate*  

Many of our modern frameworks have Dependency Injection (DI) built in. But how do you use that effectively? We need to look at what DI is and why we want to use it. We'll look at the problems caused by tight coupling. Then we'll use some DI patterns such as constructor injection to break that tight coupling. We'll see how loosely-coupled applications are easier to extend and test. With a better understanding of the basic patterns, we'll remove the magic behind DI containers so that we can use the tools appropriately in our code.  

You will learn:

* See the problems that DI can solve  
* Understand DI by using it without a container  
* See how a DI container can add some magic and reduce some code

**W17: I'll Get Back to You: Task, Await, and Asynchronous Methods in C#**  
*Level: Introductory / Intermediate*  

There's a lot of confusion about async/await, Task/TPL, and asynchronous and parallel programming in general. So let's start with the basics and look at how we can consume asynchronous methods using Task and then see how the "await" operator can makes things easier for us. Along the way, weâ€™ll look at continuations, cancellation, and exception handling.

You will learn:

* Get data back from an asynchronous method  
* Handle exceptions that occur in an asynchronous method  
* When to use "ConfigureAwait"
